### Unit Testing

`npm run test` or `yarn test` will run the unit tests, using Jest as a runner and test framework.

> Don't forget to run `yarn clear` or `npm run clear` first then run the test script, or the test coverage result would be wrong.

### Publishing

To publish, simply do:

```bash
npm run build
npm publish
```

That's it!
